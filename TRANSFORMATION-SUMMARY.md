# Language Learning Tool Transformation Summary

This document summarizes the transformation of the PM Interview MVP into a Language Learning Tool using GPT real-time.

## What Was Changed

### 1. **New State Management** (`client/src/atoms/languageState.js`)
- Created new atom-based state for language learning preferences
- Stores: personality, speed, level, style
- Manages app mode: setup → practice → history
- Maintains session and history state

### 2. **New Setup Page** (`client/src/components/language/SetupPage.jsx`)
- Beautiful UI adapted from MC language bot
- Four preference categories:
  - **Personality**: Choose conversation partner (Friendly, Professional, Humorous, Academic)
  - **Speed**: Speaking pace (Slow, Normal, Fast)
  - **Level**: Language proficiency (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Fluent)
  - **Style**: Communication style (Formal, Casual, Slangy)
- Grid-based card layout with images for personalities
- Integrated with state management

### 3. **Backend API Endpoints**
Created two new API endpoints:

#### `api/language/start-session.js`
- Accepts language preferences
- Builds tutoring system prompts based on personality, speed, level, and style
- Creates OpenAI Realtime session with appropriate voice and turn detection settings
- Returns session credentials for WebRTC connection

#### `api/language/summary.js`
- Generates learning insights from conversation transcripts
- Provides feedback on:
  - What the learner learned (vocabulary, grammar, cultural insights)
  - Areas of strength
  - Areas to work on
  - Vocabulary review
- Tailored to language learning (not interview coaching)

### 4. **Updated Main App** (`client/src/App.jsx`)
- Switched from interview flow to language practice flow
- Uses new `languageState` atoms
- Calls `startLanguageSession` API instead of interview session
- Generates learning summary instead of interview coaching

### 5. **Updated Components**

#### Sidebar (`client/src/components/Sidebar.jsx`)
- Changed labels: "Interview Coach" → "Language Practice"
- "New Interview" → "New Session"
- Uses new `appModeAtom` instead of `prepModeAtom`

#### InterviewView (repurposed as PracticeView)
- Updated labels:
  - "Interview" → "Practice Session"
  - "Interviewer" → "Tutor"
  - "Coaching Advice" → "Learning Insights"
  - "Strengths" → "What You Did Well"
  - "Improvements" → "Areas to Practice"
- Kept the voice visualization and transcript features
- End Interview → End Session

### 6. **Updated Hooks**

#### `useRealtimeInterview` Hook
- Made question stack optional
- For language practice, sends simple "Hello!" to start conversation
- Instructions are pre-built in the backend session

#### `useInterviewHistory` Hook
- Updated to use language state atoms
- Changed mode transitions: setup ↔ practice ↔ history
- Updated error messages to reference "sessions" instead of "interviews"

### 7. **Updated Services**

#### API Service (`client/src/services/api.js`)
- Added `startLanguageSession(preferences)` function
- Added `summarizeLanguageSession(conversation, preferences)` function

#### LocalStorage Service
- Added `saveSession` alias for `saveInterview`
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing storage

### 8. **CSS Styling** (`client/src/redesign.css`)
- Added utility classes for the setup page
- Grid layouts, flexbox utilities
- Responsive design helpers
- Text and spacing utilities
- Maintains existing dark theme

## What Was Kept

### ✅ Same Architecture
- Vercel serverless backend
- React frontend with Jotai state management
- WebRTC-based real-time voice connection
- localStorage for session history

### ✅ Same Core Flow
1. Setup/Configuration page
2. Live voice session with visualization
3. Transcript recording
4. Summary generation
5. History sidebar

### ✅ Same Components (Reused)
- Audio visualizer
- Transcript view
- History sidebar structure
- Session details (can be hidden/removed if not needed)

## What Can Be Removed (Optional Cleanup)

These files are no longer used but don't break anything:
- `client/src/components/prep/PrepWizard.jsx`
- `client/src/components/prep/QuestionSection.jsx`
- `client/src/components/prep/CustomCategoriesSection.jsx`
- `client/src/atoms/prepState.js` (replaced by `languageState.js`)
- `api/interview/` endpoints (if not needed)
- `api/questions.js` (question bank configuration)

## How to Test

1. **Install dependencies** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   npm install
   cd client && npm install
   ```

2. **Set environment variables**:
   ```bash
   # In root directory
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

3. **Run locally**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   vercel dev
   ```

4. **Test flow**:
   - Select personality, speed, level, and style
   - Click "Start Practicing ✨"
   - Speak with the AI tutor
   - End session to see learning insights
   - Check sidebar for session history

## Deployment

Deploy to Vercel as before:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

Make sure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in Vercel environment variables.

## System Prompts

Each personality has a unique system prompt that combines:
- Personality traits (warm/professional/humorous/academic)
- Speaking speed instructions
- Language level guidelines
- Communication style preferences

The prompts guide the AI to:
- Engage in natural conversation
- Gently correct mistakes
- Introduce appropriate vocabulary
- Ask follow-up questions
- Keep learners speaking

## Summary Generation

The learning summary provides:
- **Summary**: Overview of topics discussed
- **What You Learned**: New vocabulary, grammar, cultural insights
- **What You Did Well**: Strengths and good examples
- **Areas to Practice**: Specific mistakes and improvement suggestions
- **Vocabulary Review**: Key words/phrases from the session

**Note**: The old interview functionality could still work if you pass question stacks, maintaining backward compatibility. However, the UI is now optimized for language learning.
